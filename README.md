# AI-Powered-System-for-Generating-Quotes
We are building a cutting-edge platform that connects homeowners with contractors for remodeling and construction projects. A key feature of the platform is an AI assistant that generates instant, itemized quotes based on user-provided project details (photos, descriptions, etc.).


We are seeking a specialist to handle the integration of OpenAI’s ChatGPT API and develop the backend infrastructure to support this functionality. The role requires expertise in backend systems, API integrations, and ensuring data flows seamlessly between the front-end (handled via Webflow or similar) and the AI system.


This is a project-based role with clear deliverables and opportunities for future collaboration as the platform evolves.


Responsibilities:


    • Integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to:

        - Process user inputs (text and optional photos).

        - Generate itemized quotes for construction projects using predefined data rules.

    • Design and implement a secure, scalable backend to:

        - Handle user-submitted data from the Webflow front-end.

        - Communicate with the AI API and store/retrieve data as needed.

    •    Validate user inputs to ensure accuracy and relevance before sending data to the AI.

    •    Develop and expose API endpoints for future functionality and scalability.

    •    Implement security measures to protect sensitive data (e.g., user submissions, project details).

    •    Work collaboratively with the front-end developer (internal) and other team members.


To implement the functionality described for integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT API and creating a backend system to support an AI-powered platform for generating quotes, the following Python code can help with the backend API integration, handling user inputs, and interacting with the AI model.
Backend Structure:

    API Integration: The backend will handle requests from the front-end (e.g., Webflow), process the user inputs (text and photos), pass the necessary data to OpenAI's ChatGPT API, and return the itemized quote.
    Security & Data Validation: We'll ensure secure handling of the data and input validation.
    Scalability: The backend will be designed for future expansion, handling more complex requests or additional features.

Required Technologies:

    Python (for the backend system)
    Flask (a lightweight web framework)
    OpenAI API (for ChatGPT integration)
    SQL Database (for storing project data, user submissions)
    AWS S3 or similar (for image storage)
    JWT Authentication (for securing user data)

Step-by-Step Code Implementation:

    Install Required Libraries:

pip install flask openai flask-sqlalchemy python-dotenv boto3

    .env File for Storing Secrets:

Create a .env file to securely store sensitive information like the OpenAI API key, database credentials, and AWS S3 credentials.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name

    Flask Backend API Code:

import os
import openai
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
import boto3
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize Flask App
app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration for Flask and Database

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize Database

    prompt = f"Generate an itemized quote for the following project: {user_input}"
    
    if image_url:
        prompt += f" Project includes the following image: {image_url}"

    # Call OpenAI API to get the generated quote
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Endpoint to handle project submissions

def submit_project():
    # Get data from the frontend
    user_name = request.form['user_name']
    project_details = request.form['project_details']

    # Validate inputs
    if not user_name or not project_details:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required fields'}), 400

    # Handle image upload (optional)
    image_url = None
    if 'image' in request.files:
        image = request.files['image']
        if image and allowed_file(image.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(image.filename)
            image_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
            image.save(image_path)

            # Upload image to S3 and get the URL
            s3_client.upload_file(image_path, os.getenv('S3_BUCKET_NAME'), filename)
            image_url = f"https://{os.getenv('S3_BUCKET_NAME')}.s3.amazonaws.com/{filename}"

    # Save project details to database
    new_project = Project(user_name=user_name, project_details=project_details, image_url=image_url)
    db.session.add(new_project)
    db.session.commit()

    # Generate the itemized quote using ChatGPT
    quote = generate_quote(project_details, image_url)

    return jsonify({
        'project_id': new_project.id,
        'quote': quote
    }), 200

# Endpoint to retrieve all projects (for admin or user review)
@app.route('/projects', methods=['GET'])
def get_projects():
    projects = Project.query.all()
    projects_data = [{'id': p.id, 'user_name': p.user_name, 'project_details': p.project_details, 'image_url': p.image_url} for p in projects]
    return jsonify({'projects': projects_data})

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of the Code:

    Flask App Setup:
        A basic Flask app is set up to handle routes like /submit_project and /projects.

    Database Integration (SQLAlchemy):
        A simple database model (Project) is used to store user details like project descriptions, images, and generated quotes.

    File Upload and AWS S3 Integration:
        Users can upload photos that may be needed to generate a more detailed quote. These images are stored on AWS S3 to ensure scalability and reliability.

    ChatGPT API Integration:
        When a user submits a project, the system passes the project details to OpenAI’s ChatGPT API, which generates an itemized quote based on the description. If an image is provided, the URL to the image is included in the prompt for a more accurate response.

    Security Measures:
        Input validation is performed to ensure that the necessary fields (like user_name and project_details) are provided. Additionally, image file uploads are checked for allowed file extensions to prevent security issues.

    API Endpoints:
        The /submit_project endpoint accepts user input, processes the data, stores it, and generates a quote.
        The /projects endpoint retrieves all stored projects and their details, which could be used by the admin or for user review.

Next Steps:

    Integrate with Front-End: The Webflow front-end (or another front-end solution) can be integrated with the backend by calling these API endpoints using AJAX or similar technologies.
    Secure the API: Implement authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT) for better security, especially for private endpoints.
    Refinement: Further refine the quote generation logic, enhance error handling, and handle edge cases.

Conclusion:

This code sets up a backend system that integrates with OpenAI’s ChatGPT API and provides a secure and scalable solution for generating itemized quotes based on user input. Future enhancements could include implementing more complex quote calculations, offering additional project management features, or integrating with other services.
